# VSAI

个人使用的 Visual Studio Codex 定制版，版本 **1.0.0**。本仓库保持私有，不发布到 Visual Studio Marketplace。

主界面使用原有 Codex WebView，保留文件夹选择、会话安全、文件跳转和设置持久化修复。原生界面仅用于 WebView 加载失败时的回退。

基于 [Visual Codex Studio](https://github.com/rodrigojager/codex-visual-studio-extension) 1.3.4，保留上游历史、LICENSE 和第三方资源声明。
本地构建输出为 `CodexVsix\VSAI.vsix`，在 Visual Studio 的“视图 → VSAI”打开。

## VSAI 会话与共享记忆

VSAI 的官方模型和自定义模型统一使用独立会话库。默认目录是 `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\vsai`；如果设置了 `CODEX_HOME`，则使用该目录下的 `vsai` 子目录。数据库、会话日志、归档和运行日志均留在这个私有目录，后续对话不会进入桌面端的历史列表。切换模型不会切换会话库。

首次启动时仅复制原 Codex home 的配置、用户指令和模型缓存作为初始快照，后续设置页编辑的是 VSAI 自己的文件。第三方服务设置继续使用现有的加密存储。账号的 `auth.json` 不复制，私有客户端固定使用自己的文件凭据存储；已有配置中的服务参数保留。模型列表始终保留 CLI 返回的官方模型，并与第三方模型同时显示。首次使用官方订阅时，在设置 → 模型与服务 → ChatGPT 官方订阅中登录一次；登录完成后自动刷新状态与模型列表。VSAI 的登录、退出和认证检查都指向私有目录，不影响桌面端登录。

首次连接会自动扫描原库的普通及已归档历史，并只读核对本地索引，识别 `codex-vsix` 创建或使用 `vsai_` 服务的会话。先在 `vsai\migration-backups` 备份原始日志；分页历史连同其依赖的原始父记录复制到新库，再由 app-server 重建独立索引，保留会话 ID。仅用作历史依赖的非 VSAI 父记录在新库归档，其桌面端原记录不变。旧格式历史通过完整副本导入。ID 对应关系和进度保存在 `vsai\session-migration-manifest.json`。验证完整历史及源文件未变化后才归档原记录，原文件不会删除。原先已归档的会话在新库中仍保持归档状态；只有初始化信息、没有对话及父历史引用的空记录仅备份，不生成空会话。

正在运行、日志损坏、超出迁移大小限制或导入结果无法确认的会话会保留原记录，并提示迁移未完成；不阻止使用新库。关闭旧会话后重启 VS 可重试。若清单显示 `fork-outcome-unknown`，须先核对新库中的导入结果，不能直接清空清单重试，否则可能重复导入。旧版 WebView 缓存保留，新版使用单独缓存以避免恢复已迁移的旧 ID。

共享记忆读取原 home 下的 `memories\memory_summary.md`，并指向同目录的 `MEMORY.md`、`rollout_summaries` 和 `skills`。VSAI 在创建、恢复、分叉会话时注入这份共享上下文，关闭私有库的自动记忆生成。自动整理仍由桌面端负责，VSAI 私有历史不会自动进入桌面端的记忆提炼；用户明确要求记住的内容按共享目录的 `memories\extensions\ad_hoc\notes` 流程追加。

## Visual Codex Studio (upstream)

Run Codex inside Visual Studio without leaving the IDE.

`Visual Codex Studio` is a 64-bit VSIX for Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio
2026. It hosts the local Codex CLI through `codex app-server`, adapts the Codex
WebView to Visual Studio, and connects conversations to the active solution,
editor, theme, and user settings.

Current release: [v1.3.4](https://github.com/rodrigojager/codex-visual-studio-extension/releases/tag/v1.3.4)

## What's New in 1.3.4

- The extension makes several attempts to recover the modern Codex interface
  before using the classic fallback.
- A problem limited to the settings window no longer changes the main chat to
  the classic interface.
- Classic fallback screens now include an action to try the modern interface
  again without restarting Visual Studio.
- Provider and app-server errors are displayed more clearly, while optional
  diagnostic logs contain more useful request, response, and recovery details.

## What It Provides

### Codex inside Visual Studio

- Dockable Codex chat in the Visual Studio tool window area.
- Frozen Codex WebView adapted to Visual Studio WebView2, theme resources, locale,
  and the local app-server transport.
- Normal and plan collaboration modes.
- Runtime model discovery with model-specific reasoning options, verbosity,
  service tier, approval policy, and sandbox controls.
- Streaming assistant output, tool activity, approvals, interactive questions,
  Markdown, diffs, and Mermaid diagrams.
- Clipboard and file-picker image attachments sent as app-server `localImage`
  inputs.
- Session usage and rate-limit information when supplied by the Codex runtime.
- Bounded local recent-task history instead of the incompatible cloud-task view.

### Visual Studio context and commands

- Active document, selected text, and open editor tabs are sent through the IDE
  context contract when IDE context is enabled.
- Solution-aware `@file` search is asynchronous, bounded, and excludes generated
  directories and reparse points.
- Editor context-menu commands can add a selection to the current thread, review
  selected code, or ask Codex to implement it.
- Solution Explorer can add the selected file to the current thread.
- Visual Studio commands are available for opening Codex, starting a new agent,
  and opening settings.
- Plan questions use a separate prompt window so the main conversation remains
  visible.

### Settings

- Settings open in an independent Visual Studio document tab, leaving chat
  available at the same time.
- Changes are persisted immediately and invalidate all active chat consumers;
  there is no Apply button or extension restart requirement.
- Configurable executable path, working directory, model, reasoning, verbosity,
  service tier, profile, approvals, sandbox, follow-up behavior, composer Enter
  behavior, review delivery, managed MCP servers, and startup behavior.
- Optional local diagnostic logging for investigating display or docking
  problems, disabled by default.
- UI localization for English, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, French, and German.
- Visual Studio theme integration for light and dark environments.

### Long-conversation behavior

The extension deliberately avoids materializing an entire large conversation in
the Visual Studio WebView at once:

- Initial history is limited to the most recent 120 turns or 2 MB.
- Older history is loaded explicitly in batches of 20 turns, with a 512 KB batch
  budget.
- Large messages, diffs, tool output, and streams are limited only in the Visual
  Studio display copy. The full content remains in the Codex session history.
- Browser-native lazy rendering reduces work for content outside the visible
  viewport.
- Manual context compaction is available, with optional automatic compaction after
  a completed turn reaches 85% context usage.

These controls improve responsiveness, but they do not make conversation size
unlimited. Runtime, model-context, and machine-resource limits still apply.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio 2026, 64-bit, with the Core Editor workload.
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or newer.
- Codex CLI installed locally and available through `codex`, `codex.cmd`, or the
  executable path selected in extension settings.
- A working per-user Codex login or provider configuration.

The VSIX does not bundle the Codex CLI or an OpenAI account.

## Installation

1. Install the Codex CLI and verify that `codex --version` works in a terminal.
2. Run `codex login` with the ChatGPT account that will use Visual Studio, or
   configure that user's provider in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
3. Download the VSIX from
   [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rodrigojager/codex-visual-studio-extension/releases/latest)
   or use the Marketplace package when available.
4. Run the VSIX installer and follow its instructions for the desired Visual
   Studio instances.
5. Open Visual Studio and choose `View > Codex`. The canonical command is
   `View.VisualCodexStudio` and can be assigned a keyboard shortcut.

If authentication is missing, the extension's Account settings can open the
local `codex login` flow.

## Authentication and Local Data

Authentication always belongs to the Windows user running Visual Studio. The
recommended path is that user's own `codex login` session. Advanced local setups
can instead use:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` in that user's environment.
- Provider configuration in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- A Codex profile that selects provider-specific configuration.

No ChatGPT cookie, token, API key, `auth.json`, publisher credential, or signing
key is bundled in the repository or VSIX. The WebView is not given
`OPENAI_API_KEY` from the Visual Studio process.

Extension settings are stored at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexVsix\settings.json`, outside
the repository and VSIX. Sensitive extension settings and prompt history are
protected for the current Windows user with DPAPI and written atomically. Codex
authentication and provider configuration remain under that user's Codex home
directory and must never be copied into this repository.

When enabled, optional diagnostics are stored under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexVsix\logs`. They do not intentionally record prompts,
responses, or request contents and filter common credential formats, but error
details can still include local paths or other environment information. Review
the files before sharing them publicly.

## Configuration Notes

- Provider and profile behavior should be configured in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- The settings UI supports extra model, reasoning, verbosity, and service-tier
  entries for runtimes that expose options newer than this frozen extension.
- Additional CLI arguments, environment overrides, and raw TOML overrides are
  advanced per-user settings. They are passed to the local runtime and should be
  reviewed before use.
- Attached local images must remain readable until the turn starts.
- The embedded WebView is a frozen bundle. A future Codex CLI or protocol change
  may require source changes that this unmaintained project will not receive.

## Build and Test

Release packaging requires full Visual Studio MSBuild.

```powershell
$vswhere = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vswhere.exe"
$install = & $vswhere -latest -products * -requires Microsoft.Component.MSBuild -property installationPath
$msbuild = Join-Path $install "MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe"

[xml]$props = Get-Content Directory.Build.props -Raw
$version = [string]$props.Project.PropertyGroup.Version

dotnet restore CodexVs2026Extension.sln `
  --locked-mode `
  -p:NuGetAudit=true `
  -p:NuGetAuditMode=all `
  -p:WarningsAsErrors=NU1901%3BNU1902%3BNU1903%3BNU1904

dotnet test CodexVs2026Extension.sln -c Release --no-restore

& $msbuild `
  CodexVsix\CodexVsix.csproj `
  /t:Rebuild `
  /m:1 `
  /nr:false `
  /p:Configuration=Release `
  /p:RestoreLockedMode=true `
  /p:BuildVsixPackage=true

.\scripts\Test-VsixPackage.ps1 `
  -VsixPath CodexVsix\VSAI.vsix `
  -ExpectedVersion $version
```

`dotnet build` can compile the projects, but the final VSIX should be produced
with Visual Studio `MSBuild.exe`. The package verifier checks manifest and
assembly versions, required WebView assets, third-party runtime versions,
credential filenames, private signing material, and package signatures.

GitHub CI performs locked restore with NuGet auditing, tests, packaging, and VSIX
verification. Tagged releases are signed only when all repository signing secrets
are configured; otherwise the workflow publishes a verified unsigned package.
Visual Studio Marketplace publication is intentionally manual.

## Changelog

### 1.3.4 - 2026-07-22

- Recovers the modern interface through windowed WebView2, composition WebView2,
  and an isolated recovery profile before falling back to classic WPF.
- Detects a missing `webview-ready` signal, logs every recovery attempt, and adds
  a "Try the modern interface again" action to classic fallback surfaces.
- Keeps a settings-only WebView failure local instead of downgrading the main chat.
- Retries the official interface after Visual Studio restarts instead of keeping
  a transient WebView fallback across later sessions.
- Handles scalar errors from custom providers without a Newtonsoft `JValue`
  parsing failure and surfaces the provider's actual message.
- Records app-server requests, response outcomes, stderr, and process failures
  when diagnostic logging is enabled, without logging prompts or request payloads.
- Opens classic settings on a usable section instead of an empty panel.

### 1.3.3 - 2026-07-18

- Improved reliability when the Codex panel is docked, floating, or moved.
- Remembered the interface that works on each computer and added an automatic
  fallback, without loading two interfaces at the same time.
- Preserved the responsiveness improvements from 1.3.1 by reloading the panel
  only when Visual Studio actually moves it to another window.
- Added optional local diagnostic logs, disabled by default, and fixed their
  switch so it appears correctly under General settings.
- Expanded automated coverage for docking, fallback, diagnostics, and release
  packaging.

### 1.3.1 - 2026-07-16

- Reduced editor slowdown while the Codex tool window is open.
- Prevented the official WebView and the classic interface from loading at the
  same time.
- Kept the classic interface as a fallback when the official interface cannot
  load.
- Deferred automatic opening until Visual Studio reaches an idle state.
- Improved cleanup of the tool window and WebView resources.
- Added regression tests for the new loading and startup behavior.

### 1.3.0 - 2026-07-11

- Replaced the older presentation with the adapted Codex WebView, Visual Studio
  theme integration, Codex-style header/composer, and an independent settings tab.
- Added current IDE commands and context menus for selections, files, reviews, and
  implementation requests.
- Added active document, selection, and open-tab context using the WebView's
  expected IDE contract.
- Added runtime model discovery and host metadata so the assistant can identify
  the selected model and reasoning effort.
- Added bounded history loading, lazy rendering, display-only payload limits,
  manual compaction, and optional automatic compaction for long conversations.
- Replaced incompatible cloud task history with a bounded local task-history
  popover.
- Updated app-server support for reviews, steering, approvals, permissions,
  elicitation, plugins, MCP operations, authentication, and logout.
- Hardened process cancellation, follow-up queues, attachments, solution search,
  Markdown/Mermaid rendering, settings persistence, and WebView dispatch.
- Protected sensitive local settings with DPAPI and added package checks that
  reject credential and private signing files.
- Added locked dependency restore, NuGet auditing, 101 automated tests, reproducible
  versioning, VSIX verification, and optional release signing.

### 1.2.1 - 2026-05-01

- Refreshed the VSIX manifests and packaged extension metadata.

### 1.2.0 - 2026-05-01

- Renamed the extension to Visual Codex Studio and refreshed its iconography.
- Added conversation rename support and keyboard command registration.
- Virtualized chat history and buffered large message updates to reduce UI churn.
- Fixed history loading, rate-limit presentation, and layout instability.
